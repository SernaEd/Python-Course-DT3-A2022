# Instructions:

Write a piece of Python code that returns the string '`hello world`' if the value of an integer variable, `happy`, is strictly greater than 2.

For problems such as these, do not include `input` statements or define the variable `happy` in any way. The automated testing will provide a value of `happy` for you - so write your code in the text editor assuming `happy` is already defined.
