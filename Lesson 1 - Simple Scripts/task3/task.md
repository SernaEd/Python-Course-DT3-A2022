# Instructions:

Assume that two variables, `varA` and `varB`, are assigned values, either numbers or strings.

Write a piece of Python code that returns **one** of the following messages:

* "`string involved`" if either `varA` or `varB` are strings

* "`bigger`" if `varA` is larger than `varB` and both are numbers

* "`equal`" if `varA` is equal to `varB` and both are numbers

* "`smaller`" if `varA` is smaller than `varB` and both are numbers

<div class="hint">
  Remember the <code>type</code> function
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Recall that if you want to check whether the type of a variable is a specific kind, you can compare the type of the variable with the type of a known object. For example, <code>type(variable) == str</code>
</div>
